## Ministry of Industry and Trading

We collaborated with MIT ministry to build their Flour monitoring and distribution system. The system was done in collaboration with AZ, and Raiffeissein Saving and Credit Coop. We are more than welcome to extend this work and apply to other ministries as well. The project source code, documentation, and API are publicly available at [GitHub](https://github.com/adonese/mit)
